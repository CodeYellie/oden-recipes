        This creamy garlic penne pasta captures the essence of comfort food with its velvety white sauce enveloping perfectly cooked penne noodles. Made from simple pantry staples like butter, minced garlic, flour, milk, chicken broth, and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, it boasts a rich, cheesy flavor enhanced by parsley, garlic salt, and black pepper. Ready in just 20 minutes, this dish showcases tender pasta coated in a smooth béchamel-style sauce that's customizable—add grilled chicken, veggies, or sausage for extra heartiness.

        Ideal for busy weeknights or family dinners, the recipe starts by boiling the penne while preparing a quick roux in a saucepan, whisking in the liquids until the sauce thickens and bubbles, then melting in the cheeses for that irresistible pull. Garnished simply, it offers a mild garlic aroma and comforting creaminess that's universally loved, proving that basic ingredients can yield restaurant-quality results without fuss. Serve warm for the best experience, pairing beautifully with a side salad or garlic bread.
